# Kepler Exoplanet Analysis

#### 1. More than half of a data give a false positive disposition
#### 2. Almost all confirmed star are candidate of exoplanet after Kepler Analysis and only about 2% are false positive
#### 3. Exoplanet candidate mostly have high koi score (>= 0.8). It means chance of the existence is high
#### 4. The characteristic of exoplanet candidate that found by Kepler Telescope:
         - Mostly orbiting G,F and K type of stars;
         - Mostly found in magnitude around 14 to 16
#### 5. The chance of finding candidate of exoplanet would increased if:
        - Focus on G and K type of stars
        - Focus on magnitude around 14 to 15
#### 6. About 2.2% (98 planets) of all candidate exoplanet could be a candidate of the next earth because of their position are in the habitable zone. Mostly they orbit G type of stars like sun and then type F,K and M for the rest
