# Kepler-Exoplanet-Analysis

##### 1. More than half of a data give a False Positive disposition
### 2. Almost all confirmed star are candidate of exoplanet after Kepler Analysis and only about 1% are false positive
### 3. Exoplanet candidate mostly have high koi score (>= 0.8). It means chance of the existence is high
### 4. The characteristic of exoplanet candidate that found by Kepler Telescope:
         - Mostly orbiting G,F and K type of stars;
         - Mostly found in magnitude around 14 to 16
### 5. The chance of finding candidate of exoplanet would increased if:
        - Focus on G and K type of stars
        - Focus on magnitude around 14 to 15
